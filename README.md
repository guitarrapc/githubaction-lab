## Difference from other CI

**migration**

> * GitHub Actions -> CircleCI: [Migrating from Github Actions \- CircleCI](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/migrating-from-github/)
> * CircleCI -> GitHub Actions: [Migrating from CircleCI to GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-circleci-to-github-actions)
> * Azure pipeline -> GitHub Actions: [Migrating from Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-azure-pipelines-to-github-actions)
> * Jenkins -> GitHub Actions: [Migrating from Jenkins to GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/migrating-to-github-actions/migrating-from-jenkins-to-github-actions)

**job and workflow**

GitHub Actions cannnot reuse yaml and need to write same job for each workflow.
Better define step in script and call it from step, so that we can reuse same execution from other workflows or jobs.

* GitHub Actions define job inside workflow, and GitHub Actions cannot refer yaml from others.
* CircleCI define job and conbinate it in workflow. Reusing job is natual way in circleci.
* Azure Pipeline offer's template to refer stage, job and step from other yaml. This enable user to reuse yaml.
* Jenkins has pipeline and could refer other pipeline. However a lot case would be define job step in script and reuse script, not pipeline.

**skip ci on commit message**

GitHub Actions has no default support for `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`. Users require define `jobs.<job_id>.if` or `jobs.<job_id>.steps.run.if`.
You cannot use commit message `[skip ci]` on `pull_request` event as webhook not contains commits message playload.


* GitHub Actions need use `if` for job or step. if you want to handle whole workflow running, create `skip ci` check job and other job refer via `needs`.
* CircleCI can skip job via `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`. PR commit also skip.
* Azure Pipeline can skip job via `***NO_CI***`, `[skip ci]` or `[ci skip]`, or [others](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-pipelines-agent/issues/858#issuecomment-475768046).
* Jenkins has plugin to support `[skip ci]` or any expression w/pipeline via [SCM Skip \| Jenkins plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/scmskip/).

**path filter**

GitHub Actions can use `on.<event>.paths-ignore:` and `on.<event>.paths:` by default.

> [paths - Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpaths)

* GitHub Actions can set path-filter.
* CircleCI can not set path-filter.
* Azure Pipeline can set path-filter.
* Jenkins ... I think I need filter change from changes?

**job id or other meta values**

GitHub Actions has Context concept, you can access job specific info via `github`. 
for example, `github.run_id` is A unique number for each run within a repository.
Also you can access default environment variables like `GITHUB_RUN_ID`.

* GitHub Actions [environment variable](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/using-environment-variables#default-environment-variables) `GITHUB_RUN_ID` or [context](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context) `github.run_id`
* CircleCI [environment vairable](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#built-in-environment-variables) `CIRCLE_BUILD_NUM` and `CIRCLE_WORKFLOW_ID`
* Azure Pipeline [environment variable](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/azure/devops/pipelines/process/run-number?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml#tokens) `BuildID`.
* Jenkins [environment vairable](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project) `BUILD_NUMBER`

**Cancel Redundant builds**

GitHub Actions not support cancel redundant build as CircleCI do.
> [Solved: Github actions: Cancel redundant builds \(Not solve\.\.\. \- GitHub Community Forum](https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Actions/Github-actions-Cancel-redundant-builds-Not-solved/td-p/29549)

You can accomplish via actions. Workflow run cleanup action is the recommended.

> [Workflow run cleanup action · Actions · GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/workflow-run-cleanup-action)

This one is bit too match.

> [technote\-space/auto\-cancel\-redundant\-job: GitHub Actions to automatically cancel redundant jobs\.](https://github.com/technote-space/auto-cancel-redundant-job)

Theses are minimum specs.

## fundamentals

### Meta github context

job id, name and others.

> [Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#github-context)

### View Webhook GitHub Context

```yaml
name: view github context

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $GITHUB_CONTEXT
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
```

### runs only previous job is success

to accomplish sequential job run, use `needs:` for which you want the job to depends on.

this enforce job to be run when only previous job is **success**.

```yaml
name: sequential jobs

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $COMMIT_MESSAGES
        env:
          COMMIT_MESSAGES: ${{ toJson(github.event.commits.*.message) }}

  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: run when only build success
```

### runs only previous step status is ...

> [job-status-check-functions \- Context and expression syntax for GitHub Actions \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/context-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#job-status-check-functions)

use `if:` you want set step to be run on particular status.

```yaml
name: status step

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $COMMIT_MESSAGES
        env:
          COMMIT_MESSAGES: ${{ toJson(github.event.commits.*.message) }}
      - run: echo run when none of previous steps  have failed or been canceled
        if: success()
      - run: echo run even cancelled. it won't run only when critical failure prevents the task.
        if: always()
      - run: echo run when Workflow cancelled.
        if: cancelled()
      - run: echo run when any previous step of a job fails.
        if: failure()
```

### timeout for job and step

default timeout is 360min. You should set match more shorten timeout like 15min or 30min to prevent spending a lot build time.

```yaml
name: timeout

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  my-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 5
    steps:
      - run: echo done before timeout
        timeout-minutes: 1 # step個別
```

### Cancel redundant build

cancelling if `push is not tag` and `push is not branch "master"`.
It means push to branch will be cancelled.

```yaml
name: cancel redundant build
on: push

jobs:
  cancel:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: rokroskar/workflow-run-cleanup-action@v0.2.2
        if: "!startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/') && github.ref != 'refs/heads/master'"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: "${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
```

## branch and tag handling

### run when branch push only, skip on tag push

If you want run job only when push to branch, and not for tag push.

```yaml
name: branch push only

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - "**"
    tags:
      - "!*" # not a tag push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo not run on tag
```

### skip when branch push, run on tag push only

If you want run job only when push to tag, and not for branch push.

```yaml
name: tag push only

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "**" # only tag

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo not run on branch push
```

### tag pattern

You can use pattern on `on.push.tags`, but you can't on `step.if`.
This pattern will match following.

* 0.0.1
* 1.0.0+preview

```yaml
name: tag push only pattern

on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+*" # only tag with pattern match

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo not run on branch push
```


## commit handling

### skip ci

no default handling. use following.

`head_commit` may become null when event is `pull_request` or `push` for tag deletion.

```yaml
name: skip ci commit

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  build:
    if: "!contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[skip ci]') || !contains(github.event.head_commit.message, '[ci skip]')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $COMMIT_MESSAGE
        env:
          COMMIT_MESSAGE: ${{ toJson(github.event.head_commit.message) }}
```

### trigger via commit message

```yaml
name: trigger ci commit

on: ["push"]

jobs:
  build:
    if: "contains(toJSON(github.event.commits.*.message), '[build]')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $COMMIT_MESSAGES
        env:
          COMMIT_MESSAGES: ${{ toJson(github.event.commits.*.message) }}
```


## Issue and Pull Request handling

use [actions/github\-script](https://github.com/actions/github-script).

### skip ci on pull request title

original `pull_request` event will invoke when activity type is `opened`, `synchronize`, or `reopened`.

> [Events that trigger workflows \- GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull-request-event-pull_request)

```yaml
name: skip ci pr title

on: ["pull_request"]

jobs:
  build:
    if: "!contains(github.event.pull_request.title, '[skip ci]') || !contains(github.event.pull_request.title, '[ci skip]')"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo $GITHUB_CONTEXT
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
      - run: echo $TITLE
        env:
          TITLE: ${{ toJson(github.event.pull_request.title) }}
```
